Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Harshit,

I am writing to you from a elegant spaceship in a happy galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a red rocket in August. There are 9 Apples and Bananas of Pie here! In the
Kitchen there is a pool full of [11]. I fall asleep each night on a [12] bed of
[13] and dream of [14] [15]. It feels as though I have lived here for

running on an enormous Lamborghini!!

Best wishes,
Cecilia
