Title: The Galactic Adventure

Dear Harshit,

I am writing to you from a disabled spaceship in a strange galaxy. I found myself here one day after
going for a ride on a red rocket in August. There are 9 Apples and Bananas of Pie here! In the
Kitchen there is a pool full of oil. I fall asleep each night on a big bed of
wood and dream of swimming badly. It feels as though I have lived here for
5 hours. I hope one day you can visit, although the only way to get here now is
running on an enormous Lamborghini!!

Best wishes,
Cecilia
